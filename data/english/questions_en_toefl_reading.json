      "question": "According to the passage, which of the following best describes the primary advantage of photosynthesis in marine ecosystems?",
      "choices": [
        "It converts sunlight into chemical energy that sustains the entire marine food web",
        "It eliminates carbon dioxide from the atmosphere more efficiently than terrestrial plants",
        "It prevents algal blooms from forming in coastal waters",
        "It produces oxygen that is only used by ocean mammals"
      ],
      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "Photosynthesis is fundamental to marine food webs as it converts solar energy into chemical energy (glucose) that feeds all trophic levels. While it does produce oxygen and remove CO2, the primary advantage emphasized in academic texts is its role in energy conversion for the entire ecosystem."

      ],
      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "TOEFL reading questions often ask about inferences. The passage likely discusses phytoplankton as primary producers, which means educators and scientists recognize them as foundational to marine food chains and significant oxygen producers, even if not explicitly stated."

      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "This is a typical TOEFL inference question. The scientific principle that light necessary for photosynthesis decreases with depth is implied in discussions of underwater photosynthesis."
    },
    {
      "id": "en_toefl_reading_006",
      "question": "Based on the passage, which of the following would most likely result in a decrease in marine photosynthetic activity?",
