## Part 6: Evidence-Based Recommendations

### 6.1 For Learners

1. **Emphasis on Revision:** Multi-draft writing with substantive feedback produces 3x better outcomes
2. **Grammar in Context:** Isolated grammar study less effective than grammar embedded in meaningful writing tasks
3. **Controlled Practice:** Focused practice on specific error patterns (e.g., tense consistency) improves accuracy
4. **Model Analysis:** Studying well-written examples more effective than grammar rules alone
5. **Authentic Purpose:** Writing for real audiences (not just test prep) increases motivation and transfer

2. **Scaffolded Task Complexity:** Progress from sentence-combining → paragraph → essay prevents overwhelm
3. **Explicit Instruction:** Direct teaching of organization, transitions, and development improves scores
4. **Peer Review:** Structured peer feedback teaches critical reading and self-editing
5. **Individual Conferences:** One-on-one feedback 2x more effective than written comments alone

### 6.3 For Assessment Systems

1. **Holistic Rubrics:** Better capture of communication effectiveness vs. discrete-point grading
2. **Portfolio Assessment:** Shows growth over time; reduces test-day anxiety impacts
3. **Authentic Contexts:** Task-based writing better predicts real-world ability

## Conclusion

English writing proficiency development remains a complex challenge, with organization and coherence emerging as the primary barriers to higher proficiency. While grammatical accuracy remains important, modern assessment emphasizes clear communication and appropriate development of ideas. Evidence-based approaches focusing on revision, contextualized grammar instruction, authentic tasks, and substantial feedback show the strongest outcomes. Teachers and learners must shift from error-avoidance to communication-focus, and assessment systems must evolve to capture the full range of writing competencies needed in 21st-century contexts.
