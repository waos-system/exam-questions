## 13. CONCLUSION

The 2019-2024 TOEFL evolution shows a clear trend toward:
1. **Efficiency**: Shorter test assessing same construct domains
2. **Inference-Heavy**: Greater emphasis on understanding relationships and implications
3. **Natural English**: More authentic language use over artificial constructs
4. **Synthesis Skills**: Ability to combine information from multiple sources
5. **Practical Communication**: Real academic English over theoretical construction

Test takers in 2024-2025 should focus on developing **inference skills**, **processing speed**, and **clear organization** while maintaining **accuracy** and **fluency** standards. The test is simultaneously shorter and more cognitively demanding in terms of synthesis and analysis.
